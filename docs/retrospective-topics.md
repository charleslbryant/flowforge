## Current Topics for Discussion

### Documentation Integration in Development Process

**Context**: Documentation is critical for user adoption and developer experience, but keeping documentation in sync with development has been challenging in the past.

**Proposal**: Integrate documentation creation and maintenance directly into our development workflow:

1. **Bake Documentation into Process**: Make documentation a required deliverable for every feature, not an afterthought
2. **User Guides**: For user-facing features, commands, and workflows - create step-by-step guides with examples
3. **Developer Guides**: For APIs, SDKs, CLI tools - create technical integration guides with code examples
4. **Sync with Development**: Update documentation as part of the same PR that introduces feature changes
5. **Documentation Standards**: Establish consistent formatting, structure, and quality standards
6. **Review Process**: Include documentation review as part of PR approval process

**Questions for Discussion**:
- What documentation templates should we create to standardize our approach?
- How do we ensure documentation accuracy during rapid development cycles?
- What tooling can help us maintain documentation quality and consistency?
- Should documentation updates be part of Definition of Done for tasks?
- How do we handle documentation for experimental or beta features?

**Expected Outcome**: Clear process for documentation that ensures user and developer guides stay current with development.
