# Product Documentation

## Purpose

This directory contains foundational product documents that define FlowForge's strategic direction and vision. These are stable, foundational documents that inform but don't duplicate the dynamic roadmap managed through GitHub Issues.

## Directory Contents

### Core Product Documents
- **[product-vision.md](product-vision.md)** - Long-term product vision and strategic goals
- **[product-strategy.md](product-strategy.md)** - Strategic framework and approach

## Relationship to GitHub Issues

### What's Here (Foundational)
- **Product Vision**: The long-term "why" and strategic direction
- **Product Strategy**: High-level approach and framework
- **Stable Documents**: Information that changes infrequently

### What's in GitHub Issues (Dynamic)
- **PRDs**: Product requirements as GitHub Issues with `prd` label
- **CRDs**: Change requests and implementation plans with `crd` label  
- **Roadmap**: Dynamic prioritization using `now`/`next`/`future` labels
- **Tasks**: Individual work items with `task` label

## Usage

### For Product Planning
1. **Start Here**: Review product vision and strategy for context
2. **Create Issues**: Use GitHub Issues for all dynamic planning (PRDs, CRDs)
3. **Prioritize**: Use labels (`now`/`next`/`future`) for roadmap management
4. **Track Progress**: Use GitHub Issues, milestones, and project boards

### For Development Sessions
1. **Product Context**: Read these foundational documents for strategic understanding
2. **Current Work**: Use auto-generated task queues from GitHub Issues
3. **Decisions**: Document architectural decisions in ADRs
