# Active Session Log

## Session Information
- **Started**: 2025-07-12
- **Focus**: Context-Managed Development System Implementation
- **Task**: Setting up CMDS infrastructure and session management

## Session Progress

### âœ… Completed This Session
1. **CMDS Documentation** - Created comprehensive context management system documentation
2. **GitHub Actions Workflow** - Automated issue syncing with context integration  
3. **Enhanced Sync Script** - Added CMDS integration to generate task queues
4. **Session Context Files** - Created CURRENT_STATE.md, NEXT_TASKS.md, and this file

### ðŸ”§ Technical Changes Made
- `/docs/context-managed-development-system.md` - Full CMDS specification
- `/.github/workflows/sync-issues.yml` - Automated issue sync workflow
- `/scripts/sync-github-issues.sh` - Enhanced with CMDS task queue generation
- `/docs/session-context/CURRENT_STATE.md` - Current project state
- `/docs/session-context/NEXT_TASKS.md` - Prioritized task queue
- `/docs/session-context/ACTIVE_SESSION.md` - This session log

### ðŸ“‹ Key Decisions
1. **Automation Strategy**: GitHub Actions for issue sync + context file generation
2. **Session Boundaries**: 2-4 hour focused sessions on single tasks
3. **Context Preservation**: Structured files for state transfer between sessions
4. **Task Management**: GitHub Issues as source of truth with automated task queues

## Session Status
- **Build Status**: âœ… Clean (0 warnings, 0 errors)
- **Test Status**: âœ… 9/9 tests passing
- **Git Status**: Clean working directory, ready for commit

## Next Session Should Start With
1. Read `CURRENT_STATE.md` for project context
2. Read `NEXT_TASKS.md` for available work
3. Pick ONE task from "Now" priority
4. Update this file with new session information

## Session Context Summary
The .NET port is in excellent shape with a solid foundation:
- Health, Doctor, and Start commands fully implemented with TDD
- Clean architecture with proper service separation
- Comprehensive test suite and ADR documentation
- CMDS infrastructure now in place for efficient context management

Ready for next development session focused on Stop/Restart commands or workflow management features.
