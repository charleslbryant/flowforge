# Current State - FlowForge .NET Port

## Last Completed Task
- Workflow List Command implementation ✅
- All tests passing with full workflow management infrastructure ✅
- PR #41 approved and ready to merge ✅
- Completed: 2025-07-14

## Current Architecture

### .NET Console Application (dotnet/)
- **Framework**: .NET 8 Console Application using Spectre.Console.Cli
- **Testing**: xUnit with Moq for unit testing
- **Architecture**: Clean Architecture with Commands → Services → Infrastructure

### Commands Implemented
- `HealthCommand` - Check n8n API status ✅
- `DoctorCommand` - Full system health check ✅  
- `StartCommand` - Start n8n process in background ✅
- `StopCommand` - Stop n8n process ✅
- `RestartCommand` - Restart n8n process ✅
- `ListWorkflowsCommand` - List all workflows from n8n API ✅

### Services (Business Logic)
- `Services/HealthChecking/` - IHealthChecker + HealthChecker
- `Services/ProcessManagement/` - IProcessManager + ProcessManager
- `Services/SystemChecking/` - ISystemChecker + SystemChecker
- `Services/WorkflowManagement/` - IWorkflowService + WorkflowService

### Infrastructure (External Dependencies)
- `Infrastructure/Http/` - N8nHttpClient for API communication (extended with workflow APIs)
- `Infrastructure/Process/` - ProcessExecutor for system process management

### Models
- `Models/WorkflowSummary` - Workflow data representation

### Dependency Injection
- Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- Services registered in Program.cs with proper scoping
- Custom TypeRegistrar and TypeResolver for Spectre.Console.Cli integration

## Build Status
- ✅ Build: Clean (0 warnings, 0 errors)
- ✅ Tests: 35/35 passing
- ✅ Architecture: Services properly separated with own namespaces
- ✅ Code Quality: Following .NET conventions and patterns

## Technical Decisions (ADRs)
- ADR-0001: .NET port decision ✅
- ADR-0002: Test-driven development approach ✅
- ADR-0003: Spectre.Console adoption ✅
- ADR-0004: Health command development ✅
- ADR-0005: Doctor command development ✅
- ADR-0006: Start command development ✅
- ADR-0007: Services infrastructure separation ✅
- ADR-0008: Mode-based workflow system ✅

## Active Work
- **COMPLETED**: PRD #1 - Stop/Restart Commands for n8n Lifecycle Management ✅
- **COMPLETED**: PRD #2 planning and CRD breakdown ✅
- **COMPLETED**: Issue #22 - Workflow List Command (forge-dotnet list-workflows) ✅
- **COMPLETED**: All tasks #30-#40 for workflow list implementation ✅
- **PR STATUS**: PR #41 approved and ready to merge

## Next Major Commands to Implement
1. **JSON Output Option** - Add --json flag to list-workflows command
2. **Workflow Create Command** - Create new workflows via n8n API
3. **Workflow Delete Command** - Delete workflows via n8n API
4. **Workflow Update Command** - Update existing workflows

## Blockers/Issues
- None currently - clean build and test state

## Dependencies Status
- ✅ Spectre.Console and Spectre.Console.Cli
- ✅ Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection
- ✅ Microsoft.Extensions.Logging
- ✅ Microsoft.Extensions.Http
- ✅ xUnit and Moq for testing

## Context for Next Session

### Required Reading (Session Startup)
1. **Product Context**: Read `/docs/product/` for foundational product vision and strategy
2. **Architecture**: Read `/docs/architecture.md` for FlowForge overview and dual-implementation approach
3. **Current Progress**: Read this file (`CURRENT_STATE.md`) for development state
4. **Task Queue**: Read `/docs/session-context/NEXT_TASKS.md` for prioritized work

### Development Context
- Project is in excellent state for continued development
- TDD approach established and working well
- Clean architecture provides good foundation for additional commands
- Workflow management infrastructure now in place
- Ready to implement additional workflow commands or JSON output option
- Bash implementation available as feature reference in `/scripts/`
