## Task Details

### Issue #23: Workflow Get Command (Priority: NOW)
- **Goal**: Retrieve workflow details and JSON definition by ID
- **Command**: `forge-dotnet get-workflow <id>`
- **Approach**: New GetWorkflowCommand, extend WorkflowService with GetWorkflowAsync
- **Tests**: Valid ID, invalid ID, non-existent workflow, API errors
- **Estimated time**: 2-3 hours

### Issue #24: Workflow Create Command (Priority: Now)
- **Goal**: Create new workflows via n8n API
- **Approach**: New CreateWorkflowCommand with workflow definition input
- **Tests**: Valid workflow, invalid workflow, API errors
- **Estimated time**: 2-3 hours

### Issue #25: Workflow Activation Commands (Priority: Now)
- **Goal**: Activate/deactivate workflows via n8n API
- **Approach**: New ActivateWorkflowCommand and DeactivateWorkflowCommand
- **Tests**: Valid workflow, invalid workflow, state transitions
- **Estimated time**: 1-2 hours

## Session Planning Notes

### For Next Session
- Read CURRENT_STATE.md for architecture context
- Pick ONE task from "Now" priority
- Use TDD approach (red-green-refactor)
- Update ADR if architectural decisions are made
- Update this file when task is completed

### Context Requirements
- Minimal: Current task + basic architecture understanding
- Reference: ADRs for previous decisions
- Tests: Existing test patterns to follow
- Workflow infrastructure now available in WorkflowService
