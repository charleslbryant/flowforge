## Task Details

### Stop Command (Priority: Now)
- **Goal**: Stop n8n process gracefully
- **Approach**: TDD with ProcessManager.StopN8nAsync()
- **Tests**: Process not running, successful stop, failed stop scenarios
- **Estimated time**: 1-2 hours

### Restart Command (Priority: Now)  
- **Goal**: Restart n8n process (stop + start)
- **Approach**: Leverage existing Start/Stop commands
- **Tests**: Already running, not running, failed restart scenarios
- **Estimated time**: 1 hour

### Workflow List Command (Priority: Now)
- **Goal**: List all n8n workflows via API
- **Approach**: New WorkflowService with HTTP client integration
- **Tests**: API success, failure, empty list scenarios
- **Estimated time**: 2-3 hours

## Session Planning Notes

### For Next Session
- Read CURRENT_STATE.md for architecture context
- Pick ONE task from "Now" priority
- Use TDD approach (red-green-refactor)
- Update ADR if architectural decisions are made
- Update this file when task is completed

### Context Requirements
- Minimal: Current task + basic architecture understanding
- Reference: ADRs for previous decisions
- Tests: Existing test patterns to follow
