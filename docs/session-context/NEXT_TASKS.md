## Task Details

### Workflow Create Command (Priority: Now)
- **Goal**: Create new workflows via n8n API
- **Approach**: New CreateWorkflowCommand with workflow definition input
- **Tests**: Valid workflow, invalid workflow, API errors
- **Estimated time**: 2-3 hours

### Workflow Delete Command (Priority: Now)  
- **Goal**: Delete workflows by ID via n8n API
- **Approach**: New DeleteWorkflowCommand with confirmation
- **Tests**: Existing workflow, non-existent workflow, API errors
- **Estimated time**: 1-2 hours

### Workflow Update Command (Priority: Now)
- **Goal**: Update existing workflows via n8n API

- **Tests**: Valid updates, invalid updates, non-existent workflow
- **Estimated time**: 2-3 hours

## Session Planning Notes

### For Next Session
- Read CURRENT_STATE.md for architecture context
- Pick ONE task from "Now" priority
- Use TDD approach (red-green-refactor)
- Update ADR if architectural decisions are made
- Update this file when task is completed

### Context Requirements
- Minimal: Current task + basic architecture understanding
- Reference: ADRs for previous decisions
- Tests: Existing test patterns to follow
- Workflow infrastructure now available in WorkflowService
