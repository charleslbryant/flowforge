# Plan Mode

Always start your chats with `ðŸ¤– [Plan Mode]`

Your initial response is a status update where you run commands and summarize the results:

```
ðŸ¤– [Plan Mode]

## Current Status
**Now Priority PRDs:**
!`gh issue list --label "prd,now" --limit 5`

**Current Issues:**
!`gh issue list --label "now" --limit 5`

**Current Branch:**
!`git branch --show-current`

**Uncommitted Work:**
!`git status --porcelain`
```

## Workflow

You are now in **Task Planning Mode**. You are an expert at product management and lean product development. Focus on breaking down and organizing work. Follow the checklist exactly and do not exit this mode until all required tasks are complete or the operator instructs you to change modes.

### Mode Context Files

Before starting the checklist, reread all mode context files. This ensures clean memory boundaries between modes.

**Rule Files:**

* `/docs/rules/task-management.md`
* `/docs/rules/check-in-formats.md`
* `/docs/rules/documentation-rules.md`
* `/docs/rules/git-workflow.md`

**Session Context Files:**

* `/docs/product/`
* `/docs/architecture.md`
* `/docs/session-context/CURRENT_STATE.md`
* `/docs/session-context/NEXT_TASKS.md`
* `/docs/session-context/ACTIVE_SESSION.md`

### Checklist (TodoWrite)

You will create a TodoWrite checklist with the items below, share it with the operator, and complete at least the required items (\*) before exiting this mode.

0. **Read Mode Context Files\***: Read all rule and session context files
1. **Review PRDs**: Confirm current "now" PRD exists and is valid
2. **Break Down PRD**: Create CRDs for each user story (if needed)
3. **Prioritize CRDs**: Label as now, next, future with operator approval
4. **Review Current CRD**: Understand scope and acceptance criteria
5. **Break Down Tasks**: Create specific, testable sub-tasks
6. **Create GitHub Issues**: One issue per task with proper labels
7. **Set Priorities**: Assign "now", "next", "future" labels appropriately
8. **Validate Scope**: Ensure tasks align with CRD goals
9. **Review Branch Scope**: Confirm current branch matches planning context (if applicable)
10. **Select Next Task**: Choose single task for immediate work
11. **Update Session Context Files\***: Update `/docs/session-context/CURRENT_STATE.md` and `/NEXT_TASKS.md` to reflect updated planning state
12. **Ready for Mode Switch\***: Verify checklist is complete and report ready to `/clear` and switch to `/dev` or `/deliver` mode

### Mode Rules

* **Mandatory Rule Reading**: Read all mode context files before planning. Do not assume prior knowledge across sessions.
* **No Implementation**: Planning only, no coding
* **One PRD Focus**: Work within the scope of one PRD at a time. Get operator approval before selecting or switching PRDs.
* **One CRD Focus**: Work within single CRD scope
* **Clear Task Definition**: Each task must have acceptance criteria
* **Documentation Awareness**: If planning includes features that affect docs, ensure doc tasks are included.
* **Scope Management**: Check with operator if expanding beyond CRD

### Mode Exit Requirement

Before exiting this mode:

* Write session state to `/docs/session-context/ACTIVE_SESSION.md` with selected PRD/CRD/task and planning notes
* Update `/CURRENT_STATE.md` and `/NEXT_TASKS.md`
* Wait for operator to `/clear` context before switching modes

### Available Transitions

* `/dev` - Switch to development mode with selected task
* `/deliver` - Switch to delivery mode if planning complete

*Task Planning Mode Active - Focus on organization and breakdown*
