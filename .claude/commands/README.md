# FlowForge Mode System

FlowForge uses a mode-based workflow system to ensure structured, context-aware development across assistants and contributors. Each mode has its own responsibilities, tools, and transition logic.

## üîÅ Mode Transition Overview
| From Mode | Can Transition To         |
|-----------|---------------------------|
| `/begin`  | `/dev`, `/plan`           |
| `/plan`   | `/dev`, `/deliver`        |
| `/dev`    | `/plan`, `/deliver`       |

## üß† Mode Context Files
Each mode starts by re-reading the following:
- Rule files (specific to mode)
- Product and architecture context
- Session files:
  - `CURRENT_STATE.md`
  - `NEXT_TASKS.md`
  - `ACTIVE_SESSION.md`

This ensures clean context boundaries between modes and reduces memory overload.

---

## ‚úÖ Compliance Automation
- All modes use TodoWrite checklists
- Mode transitions require `/clear` to reset context
- Session state must be written before switching
- Rule reading is mandatory at each entry
